# Face-recognition-system
This project uses DeepFace with OpenCV to analyze faces in real-time from a webcam feed. It detects a face and displays age, gender, and dominant emotion with visual labels on the video stream. The system uses pre-trained DeepFace models, so no additional training or dataset is required.
